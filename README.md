### Enable pre-commit
This project enforces code styles. To easily check your code before creating a
pull request you should install pre-commit. This will automatically run the checks
before making the commit, and warn you if there are any errors.

__Currently only 'uk_accounting' module is checked for compliance__

If you don't have pre-commit installed see the documentation [here](https://pre-commit.com/#install)

#### Install pre-commit hooks in the project
Whilst in the Odoo-Uk-Accounting folder
```commandline
pre-commit install
```
